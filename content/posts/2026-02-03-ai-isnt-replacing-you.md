Chamath dropped a line on the pod last week that stuck with me: the people most afraid of AI are the ones who were already coasting. He wasn't being dismissive — he was pointing out that AI doesn't eliminate work, it eliminates *hiding*.

I think he's right, but only halfway.

Here's what I've seen firsthand: I'm a Solutions Engineer, not a developer. Every project on my portfolio — every single one — was built conversationally with Claude. I didn't write the code line by line. I described what I needed, iterated, and shipped. That's not cheating. That's a new skill.

But here's where Chamath's framing falls short. He frames it as a binary: you're either doing real work or you're not. The reality is messier. There are people doing *incredible* work who are still going to get disrupted — not because they were faking it, but because the work itself is getting redefined.

Think about it. A junior analyst who spends 40 hours building an Excel model isn't coasting. They're grinding. But when Claude can do that in 4 minutes, the grind isn't the value anymore. The value is knowing *which* model to build and *what questions to ask*.

That's the shift nobody wants to talk about. AI doesn't just expose laziness — it redefines what "the work" even means.

I've been living this. At Datamaran, I closed $700K+ in ARR my first year back from a career gap. During that gap, I wasn't job-hunting in the traditional sense — I was building. Learning prompt engineering, shipping side projects, figuring out how AI changes the sales engineering workflow. When I came back, I was faster than people who'd been at it the whole time.

Not because they were lazy. Because the game changed and I happened to be paying attention.

So my take: stop asking "will AI replace me?" Start asking "am I learning the new version of my job, or am I just getting better at the old one?"

The people who'll thrive aren't the ones who were always great. They're the ones who are willing to be beginners again.

Chamath's right that AI exposes something. But what it exposes isn't just who's slacking. It's who's adaptable.
