excerpt: "I shipped 20 side projects to production in a week. Not because I grinded — because AI let me focus on decisions instead of syntax."

Here's what I actually did this week: I deployed 20 projects to Vercel. Not starters. Not templates. Working apps with real functionality — a job tracker, an ESG scoring platform, a bill splitter, a multi-agent orchestration system, and a dozen more.

People hear that and assume I didn't sleep. I slept fine.

The trick isn't speed. It's elimination. When you build conversationally with AI, you skip the parts that used to eat your week: config files, dependency hell, CSS debugging at 2am. You spend your time on what actually matters — what should this do, who is it for, does it solve the problem.

I also built Link Vault — a catalog of every tweet and GitHub repo from my Claude sessions. Fifty-two entries, ten categories, searchable. Today I added a work/personal toggle so I can flip between research and my own projects instantly.

That's the thing nobody talks about. AI-assisted development isn't just faster coding — it's faster *thinking*. When implementation is cheap, you explore more ideas. You prototype three approaches instead of committing to the first one that compiles.

Some of these projects are polished. Some are rough MVPs. That's the point. The goal isn't perfection on one thing — it's getting enough ideas into the world that you can see which ones have legs.

My advice if you're on the fence about building with AI: stop planning and start shipping. The worst project you deploy teaches you more than the best project you never start.

Twenty projects. One week. All of them live. That's not hustle culture — that's leverage.
