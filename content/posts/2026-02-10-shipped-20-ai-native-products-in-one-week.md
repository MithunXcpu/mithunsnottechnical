I shipped [ESG Mesh](https://esg-mesh.vercel.app) — a B2B platform for ESG customer engagement that turns compliance into competitive advantage. Built the entire product from scratch with AI-powered workflows and a premium dark interface.

The [Value Calculator](https://value-calculator-eta.vercel.app) got a complete v3 rebuild with an AI wizard flow that guides users through ROI modeling. Added 10 financial templates, soft benefits tracking, and advanced metrics like payback period and NPV. The tricky part was balancing simplicity with the depth finance teams actually need.

I launched [Link Vault](https://github.com/MithunXcpu/link-vault) to catalog every useful tweet and GitHub repo I find, with work/personal scope toggles and concrete use case descriptions. No more losing that perfect example when I need it for a demo.

Built [PsychRef](https://github.com/MithunXcpu/psych-references) — a database of all 745 pop culture references from the TV show Psych, complete with IMDB and Wikipedia links. Used glassmorphism design with pineapple easter eggs because why build boring reference tools?

The portfolio redesign was the biggest visual overhaul. Added a WebGL aurora background, interactive "Ask Me Anything" buttons replacing static Q&A, and consolidated the chatbot into one seamless experience. Moved the interviewer section to its own page with real career context instead of generic placeholder content.

I also prototyped [IntentSight](https://github.com/MithunXcpu/buyerintent) for AI buyer intent detection from video calls, [TVCode](https://github.com/MithunXcpu/tvcode) for recreating software from TV shows, and Ralph — an autonomous agent that executes PRDs.

The pattern this week was "premium dark themes everywhere." Every project got the same treatment: glassmorphism, subtle animations, and that expensive SaaS look. I'm done with generic startup aesthetics.

Next week I'm focusing on [Printing in 2D](https://github.com/MithunXcpu/printing-in-2d) — the interview practice tool needs Tavus video avatar fixes and the desktop version needs local AI integration. Twenty products is sustainable when you ship fast and iterate faster.
